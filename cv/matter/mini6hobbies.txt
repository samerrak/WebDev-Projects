            <span style="font-size: Medium"> To Our Land by Mohammed Darwish:</span><br>
            <span style="font-size: small">
                To our land<br>
                and it is the one near the word of god,<br>
                a ceiling of clouds To our land,<br>
            and it is the one far from the adjectives of nouns,<br>
            the map of absence<br>
            To our land,<br>
            and it is the one tiny as a sesame seed,<br>
            a heavenly horizon ... and a hidden chasm<br>
            To our land,<br>
            and it is the one poor as a grouse’s wings,<br>
            holy books ... and an identity wound<br>
            To our land,<br>
            and it is the one surrounded with torn hills,<br>
            the ambush of a new past<br>
            To our land, and it is a prize of war,<br>
            the freedom to die from longing and burning<br>
            and our land, in its bloodied night,<br>
            is a jewel that glimmers for the far upon the far<br>
            and illuminates what’s outside it ...<br>
            As for us, inside,<br>
            we suffocate more<br>
            </span>
