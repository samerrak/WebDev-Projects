<---COMP303 Projects--->

1. This course was definitely an eye opener. It was fairly enjoyer but challenging at the same time, introduced a lot of topics like HTML, CSS, PHP, C, SQL, JS, Ajax, Node Js, React and much more

2. For the final project, pick team members that are willing to put in the work and learn on the job, I had a teammate that wasn't willing to put in the work and that cost my other colleague and I dearly.

3. The final project was really hard, but modelling a whole functioning useful website with a login system, database and much more was pretty cool.
